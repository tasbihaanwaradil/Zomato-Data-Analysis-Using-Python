# Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes Zomato restaurant data to uncover insights into customer preferences, restaurant types, pricing, and online ordering trends.  
Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I performed data cleaning, preparation, and visualization to better understand restaurant performance and customer behavior.
